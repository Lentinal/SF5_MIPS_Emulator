## Overview and Project Objectives:
For this semester-long project, you and your team will write an emulator/simulator which reads MIPS instructions from a MIPS executable object file and correctly simulates their behavior. The simulator/emulator must have a GUI (graphical user interface) which depicts CPU register, memory, and cache. The final deliverable should contain user elements similar to the emulator shown by Scott.
The object file will be a simple text file of address: bytecode that will load into your simulator’s “memory”. 


## Functionalities (From project proposal sheet):
1.	~~Button - Perform one machine step (instruction)~~ **Works
2.	Button - Perform one microcode step **Backburner(BB)
3.	Button - Run full speed until halt instruction **BB
4.	~~Button - Edit a value in memory~~ **SCRAPPED
5.	~~(Radio Button) Switch register, cache and memory displays between binary, hex, and decimal~~ **SCRAPPED/DISFUNCTIONAL
6.	~~Label Display cache “hit” rate~~ **SCRAPPED
7.	~~Button - Set/edit the PC value~~ **Works
8.	Button – Clear Cache **BB
9.	~~Save/Load Machine “state”~~ **SCRAPPED

## Final Deliverables (From Final Presentation sheet):
1. One load operation implemented in microcode and visible on user interface **To-Do
2. One store operation implements in microcode and visible on user interface **To-Do
3. ~~add, subtract and multiply implemented in microcode and visible on user interface. (integer only).~~
4. ~~AND, OR, NOT, and XOR implemented in microcode and visible on user interface~~
5. One caching technique implemented **To-Do 

Extra credit:
Floating point operations implemented and visible
Associative caching with TLB implemented

## Workload Planner
1. ~~Make GUI Layout~~ 
2. ~~Read file~~
3. ~~Separate and read opcode~~
4. ~~Write to register~~/memory
5. ~~Create Add/Subtract fuction~~
6. ~~Create Multiply/Divide function~~
7. ~~Create a Compare function~~
8. ~~Create a Jump function~~
9. ~~Create Step~~/microstep function
11. ~~Implement GUI Button calls~~
12. ~~Implement GUI textbox calls~~
13. ~~Only allow numbers in text box(Might need to redo all text box to be rich text) oops -KA~~ **Made the registers read-only


## Phase 1 Febuary 23, 2024
1.	Teams formed and submitted to Scott – so he can create in Canvas
2.	GitHUB Repo for source control created by team, or Scott. Scott is a member of each team’s repo
3.	Five-minute presentation to class regarding tools and plan for deliverables

## Phase 2 April 02, 2024
1.	Initial Project presentation (what is completed) “show us your progress”
2.	Project Presentation (where you are struggling/challenges)

## Phase 3 ~April 22, 2024?
1.	Complete presentation of project and deliverables
2.	Instructor and Peer review
3.	Approximately 20-25 minutes per team.
4.	Spoken presentation to a group form for graduation requirement
5.	Written User Guide
